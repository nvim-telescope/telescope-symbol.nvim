# telescope-symbol.nvim

Symbol Sources for `:Telescope symbols`.

## Installation

If you wanna use all symbol sources you can just install this plugin as usual
and you will be able to use `:Telescope symbols`.

If you are only interested in one or some of the symbol sources, download the
sources you are interested in and put them inside `data/telescope-sources/`
inside your runtimepath.

Example:
`~/.config/nvim/data/telescope-sources/emoji.json`

## Usage

By default `:Telescope symbols` will populate its finder with all symbols found.
If you are only interested in one symbol file, run:
`:lua require'telescope.builtin'.symbol{ sources = {'emoji'} }`

Or two specific files
`:lua require'telescope.builtin'.symbol{ sources = {'emoji', 'kaomoji'} }`

## Create your own source file or extend the current ones

### Format

The source files have to be decoded in json with the following format:

```json
[
  [
    "symbol",
    "description"
  ],
]

```

Symbol will be put under the cursor while description is used for fuzzy finding.

### Provided sources

We will not except any PRs for the source we provide. These sources are
automatically generated by a github action and we will do version bumps from
time to time.
But feel free to write a function, similar to those found in
`script/downloader.lua`, which will generate your desired symbol source based
on another document. We are happy to accept such a PR.

## Provided symbol sources
